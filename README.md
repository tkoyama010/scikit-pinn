# scikit-pinn

A Python package for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) with a scikit-learn compatible API.

## Overview

scikit-pinn provides an easy-to-use interface for implementing Physics-Informed Neural Networks, following the familiar scikit-learn design patterns. This allows you to leverage the power of PINNs for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and other physics-based problems with the same intuitive API you already know from scikit-learn.

## Features

- **scikit-learn compatible API**: Use familiar methods like `fit()`, `predict()`, and `score()`
- **Easy to integrate**: Works seamlessly with existing scikit-learn workflows
- **Physics-informed learning**: Incorporate physical laws and constraints directly into neural network training
